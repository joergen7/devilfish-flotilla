Air-to-Air Refueling
====================

A4-E Skyhawk
------------

F-16 Viper
----------

- enter the TACAN channel of the tanker
- enter the radio frequency of the tanker
- call "Intent to refuel"

FUEL
  - set AIR REFUEL switch to OPEN

- once under the tanker, call "Ready precontact"
- fly steady under the tanker
- the tanker calls you "You're taking fuel"
- the tanker calls you "Transfer complete"

.. HINT::
   While refueling I find the HUD distracting and, thus, turn it off.
