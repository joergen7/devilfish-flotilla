Air-to-Air Refueling
====================

A4-E Skyhawk
------------

- enter the TACAN channel of the tanker (see :ref:`Navigation A4-E Skyhawk <navigation skyhawk>`)
- enter the radio frequency of the tanker (see :ref:`Radio A4-E Skyhawk <radio skyhawk>`)
- call "Intent to refuel"
- once under the tanker, call "Ready precontact"
- fly steady with the probe in the basket
- the tanker calls you "You are taking fuel"
- the tanker calls you "Transfer complete"

F-16 Viper
----------

- enter the TACAN channel of the tanker (see :ref:`Navigation F-16 Viper <navigation viper>`)
- enter the radio frequency of the tanker (see :ref:`Radio F-16 Viper <radio viper>`)
- call "Intent to refuel"

FUEL
  - set AIR REFUEL switch to OPEN
  - wait for the blue RDY indicator on the right of the HUD to come on

- once under the tanker, call "Ready precontact"
- fly steady under the tanker
- the tanker calls you "You are taking fuel"
- the tanker calls you "Transfer complete"

.. HINT::
   While refueling I find the HUD distracting and, thus, turn it off.
