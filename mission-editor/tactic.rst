Tactics
=======

A `platform tactic` determines how a platform behaves when the AI controls it. When a platform tactic has waypoints, each waypoint can have an additional `waypoint tactic` which determines how a platform behaves when it reaches a waypoint. The platform pursues the waypoint tactic for a defined time before it resumes the platform tactic.
