Sub Standoff
============

In this tutorial you take your first steps in using the mission editor. You place two opposing submarines, give them tactics, and define winning conditions for both sides.

Select a Region
---------------

First, the mission editor prompts you to pick a region on the world map. Pick a region in the Atlantic by right-clicking. The editor faces you with a dialog where you can choose between a single mission and a campaign mission. Leave single mission selected and confirm.

.. note::

  After selecting a region the editor shows four panels. On the left is a map chart. Below it, on the bottom right, is a status bar describing the state of the editor. On the right is the scenario browser listing all items in the mission. Below the scenario browser are five buttons for placing a submarine, a surface ship, a trigger, a land-based prop, or a script.

Place Two Subs
--------------

Next, you place two submarines on the map chart. Click on the place submarine button and on a location on the map chart. A submarine icon appears on the map chart. The mission editor automatically selects the new submarine and shows the property editor instead of the scenario browser on the right panel. Edit the submarine's properties as follows:

================= ======================
Key               Value
================= ======================
Side              Side 0
Country           United States
Class Designation Los Angeles (688i) SSN
Name              Albany SSN753
================= ======================

Place a second sub with the following properties:

================= ==============
Key               Value
================= ==============
Side              Side 1
Country           Russia
Class Designation Project 971A K
